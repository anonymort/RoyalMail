          This policy explains how the Royal Mail Delivery Times project (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;) processes the

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-cat-rosewater">Data we collect</h2>
        <p>We only collect the minimum information required to generate postcode-level delivery statistics:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
          <li>
            Delivery report submissions containing postcode, delivery date, delivery time window, delivery type, and an
            optional free-text note. Postcodes are normalised to sector level. No names, account identifiers, or precise
            addresses are stored.
          </li>
          <li>
            Aggregated telemetry from Google Analytics (GA4) limited to anonymised usage metrics (page views, device
            type, approximate region). IP anonymisation is enforced by Google, and we do not collect advertising
            identifiers.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not intentionally collect special category data. Please avoid including personal details within notes.</p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-cat-rosewater">How data is stored</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
          <li>
            Production data is hosted on a managed PostgreSQL instance operated by Railway (Railway Infrastructure, Inc.)
            within the EU West region. Raw submissions are kept for audit and statistical accuracy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Development environments may use local SQLite databases which remain on the contributor&rsquo;s machine.
          </li>
          <li>Google Analytics is provided by Google LLC and stores cookies consistent with their privacy policy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Infrastructure access is limited to project maintainers via authenticated Railway accounts.</p>

      <section className="space-y-3">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-cat-rosewater">Purpose and legal basis</h2>
        <p>
          We process delivery reports to generate aggregated statistics that help communities understand typical postal
          delivery timings. The legal basis is legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f) UK/EU GDPR) because the processing is
          minimal, non-commercial, and benefits contributors who opt in by submitting data.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="space-y-3">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-cat-rosewater">Retention</h2>
        <p>
          Raw reports are retained for a maximum of 24 months to support trend validation. Aggregated metrics may be
          stored longer as they no longer relate to identifiable individuals. You may request deletion earlier by
          referencing the details of your submission.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-cat-rosewater">Your rights</h2>

          Under UK/EU GDPR you have the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict, or object to the processing of your
          personal data, and the right to data portability. Because we collect minimal contact information you may need to
          provide contextual details (postcode, delivery date/time, optional note text) so we can locate and act on a
          request.
